# Blender-sdf-parser
Parses an sdf file line by line, rendering out to images that can then be compiled into a gif

Output gifs are all 60 fps, however given the size of some they might show up choppy on lower-end devices

## Some examples of renders:
(note that github does not support gifv embeds so links need to be clicked)
(further, some images were uploaded to https://imgur.com/a/jGWrc, meaning they have a description text at the bottom that seems out of place without context)

(using OpenGL reduces render time from a matter of minutes/frame to frames/second)

(note that due to the size of the image, looking at it on a phone might not yield the smoothest viewing)
